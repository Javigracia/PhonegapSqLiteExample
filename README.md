SqLite Phonegap Example:

This example consists of a database of users or customers with name and surname.
The first window displays the database data.
Pressing new will take you to the next page where you can enter the customer's first and last name and save it or cancel it by pressing return.
On the first page, if you put a name in the text box and press search, the result will be shown below. These items listed if clicked will take you to the next page where you can edit or delete a user or cancel by clicking back.
